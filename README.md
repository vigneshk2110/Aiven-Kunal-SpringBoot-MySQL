# Aiven-Kunal-SpringBoot-MySQL

I have build REST APIs for a simple Banking application using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) and MySQL database.

I have created a simple Banking App with basic functions like  
-->creating a bank account, 
-->fetching account details, 
-->Account Deposit,
-->Account Withdrawal,
-->Deleting a bank account.
